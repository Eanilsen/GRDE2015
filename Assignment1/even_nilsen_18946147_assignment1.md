Here you see the player sneaking up behind an enemy using the environment and
 his camouflage to his advantage.

![hang](./img/hang.jpg "Hanging from a tree")
One of the many "tactical" moves you can pull of in the game. Who would not like
 to hang from a tree while firing a gun?

![croc-cap](./img/Crocodile_cap.jpg "Snake wearing the crocodile cap")
A good example of how you can use the environment to hide. The player is using
 the fact that there are crocodiles in the swamp to his advantage.
