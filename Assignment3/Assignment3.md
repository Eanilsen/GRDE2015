#### Abstract ####
I have taken the liberty to change some of the facts about the game that was previously
 stated in the brief. The main story has been changed as well as the setting being
 more defined. In this document I will flesh out one of the settlements the player
 can come across and its inhabitants. There will also be a rundown of the different
 ways the protagonist can interact with the NPC's and the different outcomes.

### 1. Game Overview ###
Øde is a choice based interactive adventure roguelite with multiple possible outcomes.
 The player creates their own character with traits and skills they see fit to be
 able to survive the desolate wasteland that is the game world. It should be possible
 to go through the game in a multitude of different ways. Depending on the choices
 the player makes some paths will close and others will open.

### 2. Game World ###
The year is 2250 and humanity has failed to solve its most basic problem, namely
 the vast amounts of waste that has collected throughout the years. After the massive
 burning of waste it did not take long before pollution killed of most of both the
 fauna and flora. Many continents was rendered uninhabitable because of smokestacks
 pluming from the waste fires. Those with power and money were quick to evacuate
 the planet for new, promising colonies only reachable by spacecraft leaving Earth
 and those not rich enough behind. Society soon collapsed and anarchy took its hold
 on the remaining denizens of Earth.

In Øde, we zoom in on Norway where the story takes place. Norway is in a severe
 state of decay and there is little that nature has not claimed back. The protagonist
 sets out to explore the ruins of civilisation in hopes of somewhere to settle
 down.

## Herberg Stene: The First Settlement ##
Herberg Stene was built by the patriarch known as Father Stene when he happened
 upon an abandoned power station after Norway was left to decay. He managed to get
 the station working and suddenly had a constant supply of electricity from which
 to build upon. Being a carpenter, he soon built the first building using the
 power station as a base. Due to the geography of Norway, a nearby, uncontaminated
 water source coming from the mountains was located. This water source not only
 gave Herberg Stene hydration, but the local fauna and flora was able to survive to.
 This has given the settlement sustenance and a solid ground for survival.

Throughout the years many travelers have come and almost as many has left without
